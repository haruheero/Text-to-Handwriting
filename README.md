## Tech stack

Text to Handwriting makes use of flask, pywhatkit, PyPDF2, docx, PIL, werkzeug, os as main libraries of python. The file is first uploaded and then stored in the uploads folder.
Then the file is read. The extension of the file is extracted then it is passed to the respective block to be further used. The file is then read by the filereaders and converted
to string and passed to pywhatkit text to handwriting library. The image is then returned and displayed on website via the flask operation.

The frontend of the website is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The navbar contains links for home, about, features and contact and a toggle button for switching between light
theme and dark theme. Flask has been used to effectively upload and download converted and original documents.
